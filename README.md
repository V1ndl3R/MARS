# MARS Group
## CIT480 Saturday
This reposity is for the collaboration, documentation, and development of the MARS Group's 'Project 0', where we were tasked with building a website running on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance. The site must be publically available over an owned DNS address securely with HTTPS.
